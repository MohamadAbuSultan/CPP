A computer is an electronic device that receives data, processes it according to predefined instructions or rules (software), and converts it into meaningful information. 
Computers are electronic devices that can process data and perform various tasks according to instructions given to them.
 They are capable of executing a wide range of operations, from simple calculations to complex computations. 
 Computers play a crucial role in modern society, influencing nearly every aspect of our lives, including communication, education, entertainment, and work.

The primary functions of a computer include: (computer functions)
1- Processing Data: Computers can process data by executing instructions provided by software programs. 
This involves performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. (convert data to useful information)
2- Storage Data: Computers can store large amounts of data in various forms, including text, images, videos, and files. 
This data can be stored temporarily in memory (RAM) or permanently on storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs).
3- Input Data: Computers accept input from users through input devices such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and microphones. Input devices allow users to interact with the computer and provide instructions or data.
4- Output: (Generates Information as output) Computers produce output in various forms, including text, images, sounds, and videos. Output devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and headphones allow users to receive information or results from the computer.
5- Control : Controls all previous steps.

1- Software  : Computer Programs, instructions and Data (Intangible)
	1_ System Software: Operating Systems (Windows, Max, Linux, Android)
	2_ Application Software: Ms Office, Photoshop, Browsers
2- Hardware, The main components of a computer include: "tangible physical parts or elements that constitute a computer system."
	1- Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is the "brain" of the computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
	It processes data and controls the operation of other components.
	2-Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile memory used by the computer to temporarily store data and instructions
	that are actively being used by the CPU. RAM is fast but loses its contents when the computer is turned off.
	3- Storage Devices: Storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) are used to store data permanently. 
	They provide long-term storage for files, programs, and operating systems.
	4- Motherboard: The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer that connects and allows communication between all other components.
	It houses the CPU, memory, storage devices, and other essential components.
	5- Input Devices: Input devices like keyboards, mice, touchpads, and microphones allow users to input data and instructions into the computer.
	6- Output Devices: Output devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and headphones display or produce results generated by the computer.

CPU in Hardware: In the context of hardware, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) refers to the physical microprocessor chip mounted on the motherboard of a computer. This hardware component is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, as it performs most of the calculations and executes instructions necessary to carry out tasks. The CPU consists of various components, including the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers, all integrated onto a single chip.
CPU in Computer Units: In the context of computer units or functional divisions within a computer system, the CPU represents a functional unit responsible for processing instructions, performing calculations, and controlling the operation of other components within the system. This functional unit is part of the central processing unit (CPU) unit, which also includes other components such as memory and control units. In this sense, the CPU unit functions as the core processing unit within the computer system, orchestrating the execution of instructions and managing data flow between different parts of the system.
In summary, the CPU in hardware refers to the physical microprocessor chip, while the CPU in computer units refers to the functional unit responsible for processing instructions and controlling the operation of other components within the computer system.

Computer Units:-
	1_ Input Unit: Involves the input of data and instructions into the computer system using input devices like keyboards and mice.
	2_ Output Unit: Focuses on presenting results, information, or processed data generated by the computer system through output devices such as monitors and printers.
	3_ Primary Memory Unit: Also known as main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory), 
	this unit temporarily stores data and instructions actively used by the CPU for processing.
	4_ Secondary Storage Unit: Involves long-term storage of data and programs on storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
	5_ Central Processing Unit (CPU): The core component responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, 
	and controlling the operation of other components within the computer system.
