A computer is an electronic device that receives data, processes it according to predefined instructions or rules (software), and converts it into meaningful information. 
Computers are electronic devices that can process data and perform various tasks according to instructions given to them.
 They are capable of executing a wide range of operations, from simple calculations to complex computations. 
 Computers play a crucial role in modern society, influencing nearly every aspect of our lives, including communication, education, entertainment, and work.

The primary functions of a computer include: (computer functions)
1- Processing Data: Computers can process data by executing instructions provided by software programs. 
This involves performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. (convert data to useful information)
2- Storage Data: Computers can store large amounts of data in various forms, including text, images, videos, and files. 
This data can be stored temporarily in memory (RAM) or permanently on storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs).
3- Input Data: Computers accept input from users through input devices such as keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and microphones. Input devices allow users to interact with the computer and provide instructions or data.
4- Output: (Generates Information as output) Computers produce output in various forms, including text, images, sounds, and videos. Output devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and headphones allow users to receive information or results from the computer.
5- Control : Controls all previous steps.

The main components of a computer include:
1- Software  : Computer Programs, instructions and Data (Intangible)
	1_ System Software: Operating Systems (Windows, Max, Linux, Android)
	2_ Application Software: Ms Office, Photoshop, Browsers
2- Hardware 
	1- Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is the "brain" of the computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
	It processes data and controls the operation of other components.
	2-Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of volatile memory used by the computer to temporarily store data and instructions
	that are actively being used by the CPU. RAM is fast but loses its contents when the computer is turned off.
	3- Storage Devices: Storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) are used to store data permanently. They provide long-term storage for files, programs, and operating systems.
	4- Motherboard: The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer that connects and allows communication between all other components.
	It houses the CPU, memory, storage devices, and other essential components.
	5- Input Devices: Input devices like keyboards, mice, touchpads, and microphones allow users to input data and instructions into the computer.
	6- Output Devices: Output devices such as monitors, printers, speakers, and headphones display or produce results generated by the computer.
